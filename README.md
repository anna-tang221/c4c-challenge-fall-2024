This is the starter code for Code4Community's technical challenge for Fall 2024. 
For more detailed information about each of the parts of this starter code, check out the [`INFO.md`](INFO.md) file

## Overview
The goal of this application was to serve as a partner dashboard, allowing users to view, add, and delete partner information. However, I was only able to design a display of a list of partners.
- `PartnerTile`
   - displays the partner's name, logo, and description given partnerData
- `PartnerList`
   - iterates over the `partners` array and renders a `PartnerTile` for each partner
## Reflection
Prior to this, my only exposure to web development was attending NUWIT's Website Hack day where I got a very quick crash course to web development, but only grasping a understanding of HTML/CSS basics. When I began this challenge, I was very optimistic and thought I can learn the basics of React myself, but there was a much bigger learning curve than I thought and quickly got overwhelemed which resulted in me deciding to not continue with my application. However, I decided last minute to try again because it is a skill I want to learn, but now with the time crunch I was on I didn't get too far. 
The biggest thing I learned from attempting this challenge was to work my way through one thing at time, and not overlooking the basics. My biggest mistake was approaching head on instead of learning where to break things down and there for not knowing where to start, especially using React. If I had more time I would have taken the time to actually learn the basics of React, before even looking at what the challenge wanted instead of trying to learn as I went (which obvisouly backfired). 
In conclusion, although this was not my best work, this was an overall very interesting expierence and motivated me to actually take the time to work on my web development skills in my free time after summer classes are finished.
